# paultibbetts.uk

This is the repository for most of the code that makes up my personal website
at https://paultibbetts.uk. It's built on WordPress using [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock)
as the "stack" and [Trellis](https://roots.io/trellis) which manages environments,
provisioning and deployment.

The rest of the code is split between the [styleguide](https://github.com/ptibbetts/styles.paultibbetts.uk)
and the [theme](https://github.com/ptibbetts/allusion).
